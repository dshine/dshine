## FrauenLoop

I am very lucky to be involved in the FraueLoop initiative here in Berlin, where we are trying to improve diversity and inclusion in the Tech Field. We have pulled together an amazing team of tech professionals who mentor women in their tech careers. 

### Talks & Workshops

One of the most fun aspects of FrauenLoop for me are the talks and workshops that we arrange. I genereally try to stay behind the scenes but I have also had the pleasure of being a speaker at a number of these events.

The look of shock when you tell people that they have 10 seconds to grab HR's attention never changes.">
